## 🌟 Why AI Test CLI?

Most AI testing tools just write boilerplate code and give up when tests fail. **AI Test CLI is different.** It operates like a real Senior QA engineer using a fully autonomous "Agentic Loop":

1. **Intelligent Generation**: It reads your file, understands its imports, scans your workspace structure, and writes comprehensive tests using your existing framework (Jest, Vitest, Mocha, etc.).
2. **Massive File Support**: Got an 11,000+ line controller? No problem. The **Agentic Chunking Generator** explores the file function-by-function, incrementally building out coverage without blowing up LLM token limits.
3. **Smart Context for Local Models**: Running Ollama on a MacBook? The CLI automatically detects Local LLMs and engages "Extreme Chunking Mode" to guarantee your computer never crashes from context-window overflow.
4. **Autonomous Auto-Fixing**: It actually *runs* the tests it writes. If they fail, it reads the error stack trace, uses search tools to inspect the broken dependencies, and dynamically applies patches until the test passes.
5. **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: Supports DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Local Models (Ollama/LMStudio) via the Vercel AI SDK.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Install globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g ai-test-cli
```

Initialize the configuration in your project root. This creates an `.aitestrc.json` file.

```bash
aitest init
```

Set your API key in your `.env` file, or set it in your environment:

```bash
# Depending on your chosen provider:
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."
export CUSTOM_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Generate Tests

Generate a test suite for a single file:
```bash
aitest generate --file path/to/your/file.ts
```

Generate tests for your entire project (this will skip files that already have tests):
```bash
aitest generate --all
```

**Iterative Coverage**: If a test file already exists, running `aitest generate` again will automatically evaluate the existing file for missing coverage and append tests for untested functions!

### Auto-Fix Broken Tests

Got a test suite that's failing because of broken mocks or outdated logic? Unleash the agentic fixer:
```bash
aitest fix
```
The AI will run your entire test suite, isolate the failures, analyze the error stack traces, and incrementally patch your test files until they turn green.

### Explain Failures
Don't want the AI to fix it for you? Just ask it to explain why a test is failing:
```bash
aitest explain
```

## 🧠 Supported Providers

The CLI supports the following providers out of the box via your `.aitestrc.json`:
- `deepseek` (Highly Recommended: 128k context, extremely cheap)
- `openai` 
- `anthropic`
- `gemini`
- `ollama` (Local models, automatically triggers Smart Context chunking)

---

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

AI Test CLI is built with strict API billing safeguards:
- **Stagnation Protection**: If the AI gets confused and fails to write a test chunk after 10 attempts, it safely aborts.
- **Duplicate Action Protection**: If the AI falls into a hallucinatory repetition loop, the CLI detects it and breaks the loop instantly to save your API credits.
- **Smart Context**: Drastically reduces token consumption for massive files by chunking out irrelevant lines during the repair loop.
